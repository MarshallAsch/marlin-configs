# Marlin 2.1.1

This repository contains all my marlin configuration files for my Ender3 printer.
This exists because I found I had 3 different marlin folders on my computer with different firmware configurations and I did no know which one was the 'real' one.
So now I can start again and version control my configuration files to figure out that is running on the printer and what settings I have changed.

The old configuration files can be found in the `old-config-a` and `old-config-b` branches.
I suspect that the `old-config-a` is the most up to date one because it was in a marlin 2.0.1-bugfix folder.
